            <h2>Large Scale</h2>
            <p>Most things we buy in our day to day experience are made in a huge factory on a large scale. Each of us participates
                in the making of these products. Whether it be by purchasing them or by making them, we all play a part of
                many different industries.</p>
            <p>
                There are many different industries and being industrious in each of these industries has different requirements. However
                they all have a way of creating value and enticing us to buy their products.
