            <p>While industrious can apply to a large industrial factory industrious can also apply to people who like to take
                matters into their own hands. There are those who prefer to fix old broken things, to save money or complete
                the challenge. THere are also many people who love to build or create new things. This is a different type
                of industriousness but it is just as important to society.</p>
            <p>
                Interestingly enough there, even though more and more of the things we need in life can be purchased from a store, there
                has been a semi-recent push to learn to build things for oneself. Or to create things that have never been
                done before. This is another example of those things that are industrious.
