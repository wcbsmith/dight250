00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It is the 31st century.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.900
Ulysses killed the giant Cyclops

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.250
when he rescued the children and his son Telemachus,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.850
but the ancient Gods of Olympus are angry

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and threaten a terrible revenge.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
Mortals, you defy the Gods?

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.000
I sentence you to travel among unknown stars.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.650
Until you find the Kingdom of Hades,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.500
your bodies will stay as lifeless as stone.
