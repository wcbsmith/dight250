       There are few things that make me as nostalgic as a giant pile of the greatest toy on earth, Lego.

       I will forever remember pouring over a giant pile of brightly colored pieces to find just the right part to complete whatever masterpiece I was working on. Even to the point of staying up late and trying as hard as I could to move the pieces as quietly as possible so I didn't alert my parents to the fact that I was still awake. Just so I could finish whatever it was I had dreamed up.
