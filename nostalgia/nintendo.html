        If I were to think of the one thing that I spent most of my time on as a kid it was spent with one of Nintendo's great products.

        Whether it was my first translucent purple Game Boy Color whose life ended far too soon after a simple swim in a toilet. Or my awesome fire red GameBoy Advanced SP that followed after a summers worth of extra chores. They took me on many adventures with Pok&eacute;mon, Mario and good ol' Donkey Kong.

        Nintendo always makes me feel nostalgic.
