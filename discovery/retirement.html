            Discovery was decommissioned on March 9, 2011. NASA offered Discovery to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space
            Museum for public display and preservation, after a month-long decontamination process, as part of the national
            collection. Discovery replaced Enterprise in the Smithsonian's display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in
            Virginia.
        </p>
        <p> Discovery was transported to Washington Dulles International Airport on April 17, 2012, and was transferred to the
            Udvar-Hazy on April 19 where a welcome ceremony was held. Afterwards, at around 5: 30 pm, Discovery was rolled
            to its "final wheels stop" in the Udvar Hazy Center.
