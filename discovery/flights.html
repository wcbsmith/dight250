        <p>By its last mission, Discovery had flown 149 million miles (238 million km) in 39 missions, completed 5,830 orbits,
            and spent 365 days in orbit over 27 years. Discovery flew more flights than any other Orbiter Shuttle, including
            four in 1985 alone. Discovery flew all three "return to flight" missions after the Challenger and Columbia disasters:
            STS-26 in 1988, STS-114 in 2005, and STS-121 in 2006. Discovery flew the ante-penultimate mission of the Space
            Shuttle program, STS-133, having launched on February 24, 2011. Endeavour flew STS-134 and Atlantis performed
            STS-135, NASA's last Space Shuttle mission. On February 24, 2011, Space Shuttle Discovery launched from Kennedy
            Space Center's Launch Complex 39-A to begin its final orbital flight.
