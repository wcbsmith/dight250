    <title>SPACE! It's Out There.</title>

      <p>I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine.</p>

      <p><a href="#bottom">Failure</a> is not an option.</p>

      <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <p>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.</p>

      <p>You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.</p>

      <p>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</p>

      <p>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p>

      <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

      <p>Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.</p>

      <p>When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!</p>

      <p>We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.</p>

      <p>That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.</p>

      <p>Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.</p>

      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <p>We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.</p>

      <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

      <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

      <p>It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.</p>

      <p>I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.</p>

      <p>Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.</p>

      <p>You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.</p>

      <p>The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.</p>
