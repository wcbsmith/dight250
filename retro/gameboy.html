                For me the golden age of my video gamehood, would be the days of the GameBoy Advanced SP.

                I originally got my first GameBoy from a pawn shop. It was a translucent purple GameBoy Color. It was with me almost as much
                as my phone is today. I probably don't even want to know how many AA Batteries I burned through before the
                fateful day that my GameBoy decided to go for a swim in the toilet.

                This was the end of my trusty friend, however it was even greater motivation for me to work towards buying my own GameBoy
                Advanced SP. They had just come out and it was exactly what I wanted. However my parents let me know that
                I had to earn the money on my own and buy it myself. So I did!

            <p>
                I bought the magnificent fire red version that is pictured above. I played many an hour late into the night because it now
                had a back lit screen! But then I went and decided to do a very terrible thing...
