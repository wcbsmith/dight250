                A friend of mine was selling his PSP, and I mistakingly thought that the PSP was a console superior to my trusty Fire Red.
                So I gathered all of my GameBoy Games and Accessories and headed to the local GameStop to see what I could
                get for it. :'(
            </p>
            <p>
                I sold it all.
            </p>
            <p>
                I then turned around and bought the PSP from my friend and tried to be cool. I played FIFA Street, and Iron Man, instead
                of faithfully searching to Catch 'em all. It was fun, don't get me wrong but it definitely wasn't as fun,
                and I never new how much I would one day miss good ol' Fire Red.
