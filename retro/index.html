                There's nothing quite like a turn to (in my opinion) some of the greatest video game consoles out there. For me retro isn't
                quite as old as some may say, but hey maybe that's because I can now get a microSD card big enough to hold,
                what would have taken up an entire basement of games from some of my favorite consoles.

                So come join me on a my own adventure through gaming consoles and the story of one of my biggest regrets in life.
