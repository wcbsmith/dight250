                Luckily there are many others who are as nostalgic as I am so they have created ways to reach back into the past and play
                the games that I wasted my nights away playing. There is a humongous community of makers and builders that
                have created emulators that allow you to play old games on your own computer. However I find that using my
                keyboard just isn't the same a it used to be. Luckily there is a way to use the old style controllers as
                well.

                Enter <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">Retropie</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can buy a Raspberry Pi for around $35, and a set of retro bluetooth controllers for around $50. Then with a little tinkering
                and youtubing you are ready to play all, and I mean ALL of the games that could be played on the old consoles
                on your big screen.

                Someday when I have a little more cash to burn I will probably begin scouring the internet to find a second Fire Red GameBoy
                Advanced SP and the great games to go with so I can fully relive my childhood experience, but for now ROMS
                will get me through.
