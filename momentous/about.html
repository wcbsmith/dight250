                I am a senior in Manufacturing Engineering Technology. However despite my class status I will not be graduating until April 2019. (That's ok it give me time to take the 350 class as well.) I am from South Jordan, Utah and my wife and I have been married for almost two and a half years.

                I have learned web programming basics on my own through lots of online tutorials so I am looking forward to being able to learn and practice regularly. I am currently the Web Manager / Developer / Webmaster for my mother-in-law's violin shool.
