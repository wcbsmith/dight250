        <h2>When Dinosaurs Attack</h2>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>The thing dinosaurs is that they are very big. There are small ones, from housecat to human size, but mad scientists don&rsquo;t bother wasting their time cloning those to go on rampages.</p>

        <p>Think about it. Why go through all that effort, right? Just use DELPHI derived brainwave interception tech on cats or apes or something. Same result as a fraction of the cost.</p>

        <p>So we can safely assume the dinosaurs you are likely to face on the job will be very big indeed. And that&rsquo;s the least of your worries.</p>

        <p>Consider: it is <em>immensely difficult</em> to clone and grow an army of huge dinosaurs. It&rsquo;s why World War 2 was ended with nuclear weapons instead of dinosaurs. In other words, it was easier to invent fission than to bring back the dinosaurs, and <em>inventing fission</em> was the single most expensive experiment in history.</p>

        <p>Therefore, if you are faced with an army of huge dinosaurs, that means the person who made them already figured out the hard parts of genetic engineering. Adding weaponized customizations is relatively trivial!</p>

        <p>This is why the huge dinosaurs you might encounter will look more like something out of a movie than a textbook. Expect a standard array of melee advances at a minimum&mdash;spikes, horns, and armor. The blueprints of each one are there, it&rsquo;s just a matter of copying them into new beasts. Blades are to be less expected, but should not, by any means, be considered rare. It&rsquo;s a little extra work, but biologically speaking they&rsquo;re nothing but armor of a specific shape with a razor edge.</p>

        <p>The good news is that so-called &ldquo;super healing&rdquo; is, thankfully, <em>quite</em> uncommon.</p>

        <p>The bad news is that we honestly have to say, &ldquo;For now.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Its tactical advantages are undeniable, but the hurdles of implementing it have yet to be satisfactorily overcome.</p>

        <p>First, there&rsquo;s the energy problem. Hyper-accelerated metabolisms are, obviously, <em>hyper-accelerated</em>. One solution, pioneered by the brilliant Dr. Shinka in his work on &ldquo;biomega beasts&rdquo;, is producing a mitochondrial structure that can build excessive internal heat. This energy is limited by overall caloric availability and the stresses exerted on all other organs, but results in the most stable, if ultimately sparse, super healing fuel source this far encountered in the field.</p>

        <p>The worse news is that an unintended side effect of this procedure results in what is commonly referred to &ldquo;eye beams&rdquo; or &ldquo;fire breath.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Good luck with those!</p>

        <p>The other major hurdle is the &ldquo;on/off problem.&rdquo; Simply put, the difference between useful super healing and what can only be termed &ldquo;turbo cancer&rdquo; is a subtle one.</p>

        <p>The terrible news is that this can be used as a weapon too! What&rsquo;s better than a giant invincible rampaging monster? The same one, only it can&rsquo;t stop growing <em>and</em> it can metabolize any organic matter.</p>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t worry, there&rsquo;s more.</p>

        <p>The worst news is that the difficulty of implementing proper super healing is moot anyway, as the odds of actually injuring a huge rampaging (probably armored) dinosaur with man portable weapons are only technically non-zero. This works in your favor! In a bleak kind of way. Mad science outfits see little reason to invest significant resources and manpower into researching difficult super healing solutions when they don&rsquo;t really need them.</p>

        <p>This means the super dinosaurs you&rsquo;re likely to face aren&rsquo;t <em>entirely</em> invincible.</p>

        <p>Yet.</p>

        <p>Hey, it&rsquo;s something!</p>

        <p>So, what do you do?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Don&rsquo;t bother shooting. A good rule of thumb: if your gun is lighter enough to carry, there&rsquo;s no point using it.</li>

          <li>If you have heavy artillery, think before you shoot. At this level you might actually get the creature&rsquo;s attention. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but most certainly not a good thing either. Have a plan before pulling the trigger.</li>

          <li>Air strike, air strike, air strike! Tesladyne has woefully few fighter jets (i.e. zero), so we have never been in a position to pull off this one. But if you&rsquo;ve got a General and his walkie-talkie nearby, definitely do this.</li>

          <li>Ride it. No, really. It&rsquo;s completely unintuitive and it does little to remove you from danger, but trust us, it works. Climb aboard. Get on its back, secure yourself at the shoulders and/or near the base of the neck, and ride the thing like hell.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Seriously, when all else fails, and it probably will, riding works. We&rsquo;re not sure why, but the leading theory is that it&rsquo;s a bit like when you scruff a cat. Even a wholly engineered genetic monstrosity has four billion years of echoes working through its DNA, and somewhere along the line a mother rearranging its young made a strong impact.</p>
