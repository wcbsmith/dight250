        <h2>Are You Living Inside A Simulation?</h2>

      <section>
        <p>The short answer: yes, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>

        <p>The long answer is a tough one. Psychologically, that is. The concept is simple enough, but its ramifications go deep into some bizarre territory. Let&rsquo;s dive in!</p>

        <p>It starts as a thought experiment.</p>

        <p>Suppose that computer processor speed continues to increase. Eventually, we&rsquo;ll reach a roadblock, call it the laws of Physics, where the <em>physical limitations of matter itself</em> won&rsquo;t let us make processors go any faster. Very briefly: we make faster computers by engineering processors built out of ever-smaller pieces so more processors can fit in the same space. There is a point beyond which we cannot make the pieces any smaller because, other unavoidable physical constraints aside, silicon atoms only come in one size.</p>

        <p>We&rsquo;re not at that point yet, but we&rsquo;re getting closer to it every year and are close enough now that what&rsquo;s to be done when we get there is a serious topic of research in the industry.</p>

        <p>There are a few ways around this roadblock. Mostly they amount to figuring out a different way to put processors together. People are already working on a variety of alternatives, and progress to far is promising.</p>

        <p>This processor speed roadblock stuff will be important later on. Anyway, back to the thought experiment!</p>

        <p>At some point on the other side of the processor roadblock, we will discover we have access to enough computing power to run a simulation of the universe so complete as to be indistinguishable from reality.</p>

        <p>If one day we <em>can</em> build one of these simulations, there will be no reason <em>not</em> to. You can learn a tremendous amount about your own universe from a simulation like this, especially by tinkering with its assumptions: make time move faster so you can see its end state, alter universal constants here and there to see universes that might have been, and so on.</p>

        <p><em>Here&rsquo;s where it gets strange.</em></p>

        <p>If we ever <em>will</em> have the ability to create on of these simulations, whether its in ten years or a thousand, and there is <em>already</em> a 50/50 chance that our universe already <em>is</em> one. Since the simulation will be indistinguishable from reality, especially to those inside it, your memory of having been real your whole life isn&rsquo;t terribly effective proof that you aren&rsquo;t simulated.</p>

        <p>On the bright side, 50/50 isn&rsquo;t bad! That&rsquo;s still a pretty fair shot at getting to live in the real universe where one day they&rsquo;ll develop perfect reality simulation tech.</p>

        <p><em>And here&rsquo;s where it gets worse.</em></p>

        <p>If one of these simulations is developed in the future, then soon after there will be enough processing power to run another. Consider that it will be to perfect it further to allow for multiple simulations. And then many more. In fact, you&rsquo;d want as many running as possible so you could run experimental universes alongside control universes.</p>

        <p>Each simulated universe increases the odds that you are in one of the simulations. And it balloons pretty quickly. It&rsquo;s 1/X, where X is equal to the number of simulated realities +1.</p>

        <p>If there are never any simulations, then it&rsquo;s 1/1. You are definitely real. Good for you!</p>

        <p>With one simulation, it&rsquo;s 1/2. You&rsquo;ve got a 50% chance to still be real. Not bad.</p>

        <p>With ten simulations, 1/11, your chances are little over 9%.</p>

        <p>But, hey, 9% isn&rsquo;t the end of the world. We&rsquo;ve all accomplished something in our lives tha only had a 9% chance of working out. Probably a few times. Maybe lots!</p>

        <p>But of these simulations can be done <em>at all</em>, then there will be <em>many of them.</em> A quantum computer will run about <em>40 quadrillion times faster</em> than the fastest silicon processor ever will. And when running them becomes as common and trivial as using smartphones today, you&rsquo;ll have less than a billionth of a percent chance to be real. Flipped around, that&rsquo;s a 99.999999999% chance your universe is a simulation.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s not all bad! Kind of.</p>

        <p>There&rsquo;s one way to improve those odds. In fact, it&rsquo;s <em>guarantee</em> that you&rsquo;re a real part of the real universe.</p>

        <p>If we never develop the technology to make those simulations in the first place, then there are never any simulations made and you are definitely 100% a real thing.</p>

        <p>Demand for ever greater processing speed will always be great enough to justify the resources spend to acquire it. If alternative methods haven&rsquo;t been developed before we hit the roadblock mentioned earlier, then demand to <em>find</em> those alternatives increases. We cannot currently guess what shape these alternate processing technologies will take, but recent strides in quantum computing theory suggest the roadblock will be a temporary speed bump at most.</p>

        <p>In any case, nothing suggests that getting the processing power to run a perfect reality simulator is impossible. Or even unlikely! It&rsquo;s just a matter of time and experimentation. So, what would stop us from running the simulations? The most likely reason is the total breakdown of our modern technological civilization!</p>

        <p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a doomsday asteroid, or nuclear winter, or peak oil. Hopefully these things will only happen after you die at a ripe old age of natural causes, so you got the full benefits of being completely real without any messy apocalyptic-type problems.</p>

        <p>Never mind, you still aren&rsquo;t real.</p>

        <p>Probably when we were talking about these perfect reality simulations, you were thinking about super advanced but still Earthly technologies being used to conduct experiments by human scientists.</p>

        <p>Haha, nope.</p>

        <p>There&rsquo;s no requirement for these simulations to be run by humanity&rsquo;s computers. Maybe aliens find the echoes of our broadcasts, or maybe the sun-scoured ruins of our dead surface world a billion or two years from now. Whatever it is, they want to put together a picture pf what we might&rsquo;ve been like.</p>

        <p>Not that they need a reason to simulate us specifically. In fact, there&rsquo;s no reason to expect the simulation of us is based on <em>anything</em> real. It&rsquo;s <em>far</em> more likely humanity, all of civilization, and the Earth itself are just random outputs of a simulation. None of it ever &ldquo;happened&rdquo; in the one real universe where they&rsquo;re doing these simulations. It&rsquo;s most likely we&rsquo;re not even a part of the experiment they&rsquo;re interested in watching.</p>

        <p>Should we mention that part of the simulation includes the possibility that inhabitants of <em>those</em> universes could run their own simulations? Because that turns the already bleak odds that we;re in the real universe into something a little closer to one in an infinity.</p>

        <p>It can be difficult to come face to face with the simulated nature of &ldquo;reality&rdquo; as you know it. A common question among hyperdimensional mathematicians and computational scientists is, &ldquo;If nothing is real, then why shouldn&rsquo;t I just straight up kill lots of people?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>This is why Tesladyne requires <em>every</em> hyperdimensional mathematician and computational scientists to have a &ldquo;buddy&rdquo; in the same unit who is <em>NOT</em> a hyperdimensional mathematician <em>OR</em> computational scientist. It&rsquo;s easier to talk someone down from the more extreme implications of nothing being really if you yourself aren&rsquo;t already fully aware they&rsquo;re probably right.</p>

        <p>But they aren&rsquo;t right. Here&rsquo;s the thing: it&rsquo;s vastly more likely that our universe and its billions of years of history are nothing but several trillion blips in a quantum computer, but the simulation is still <em>our universe.</em> It&rsquo;s not real in an objective sense, but it&rsquo;s real with respect to itself and everything inside it. That includes you and everyone else.</p>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t kill people.</p>
