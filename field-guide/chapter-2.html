      <section>
        <p>Like RADAR before it, LASER is one of those acronyms that entered the hallowed halls of just being a word. Laser. Technically it stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, though around the Tesladyne Offices, it more commonly stands for What Is That Burning Smell?</p>

        <p>The problem with lasers isn&rsquo;t so much the laser-ing itself, but the fact that they can be so easily added to <em>absolutely anything.</em> Monsters, robots, cars, microwaves, cybernetic limbs, lampposts, sharks (obviously), swords, and on and on.</p>

        <p>Look, if it&rsquo;s a noun, someone has found a way to do a laser on it. And if they haven&rsquo;t, you can be assured a lot of money was spent before it was determined too impractical to lase up.</p>

        <p>This potential this ubiquity creates, in some of our field agents, a paranoid dread. The strain of expecting a laser blast around every corner will do more harm in the long run than ever getting shot with one.</p>

        <p>Seriously, the laser blast will likely cauterize the wound it creates. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t dangerous, but it&rsquo;s an attack that does First Aid <em>for</em> you. There are worse things out there!</p>

        <p><img src="images/dangerous-lasers.png" alt="Lasers are dangerous!" /></p>

        <p>For instance: chronic stress from worrying about how just about anything could shoot you with a laser! Stress causes a host of physical and mental problems that can disrupt every aspect of your life. We have a whole Yoga R&amp;D section to help you with this stuff. Drop by if, say, you break into a nervous sweat when you&rsquo;re being checked out at a grocery store.</p>

        <p>The flipside of <em>lasers everywhere</em> is that almost no one employs them as weapons anymore. They were huge in the &lsquo;80s and &lsquo;90s. Unavoidable, really. You&rsquo;d even see them strapped onto conventional firearms, as if a machine that does nothing but <em>shoot a lot of bullets</em> wasn&rsquo;t already weapon enough.</p>

        <p>Luckily for our agents today, lasers fell out of favor around the turn of the century. They&rsquo;re still all over the place, but in more subtle ways. It doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re <em>harmless</em> just because they aren&rsquo;t weapons. Range finding, target acquisition, various scanning tech, <em>these</em> laser applications and more can be applied against your person in ways that will just ruin your day when paired with another weapon system. Our very own Tesladyne Charges Particle Beam Cannon, a.k.a. the Lightning Gun, first discharges a (mostly) harmless laser at invisible wavelengths to better "prime" the path the electrical discharge will take in the following millisecond. Lightning Guns built before we developed this technology have less than half the effective range of today&rsquo;s models!</p>

        <p>But, no, anymore you won&rsquo;t see an honest to goodness laser blaster in the field unless you&rsquo;re up against Daedalus Combat Cyborgs. Daedalus seemed to stop getting memos about mainstream aesthetics in 1996. You might also find lasers among the occasional low budget black ops mercenary science crew outfitted at the Cold War Surplus discount counter at Department Zero&rsquo;s black market. But these types are already rare and becoming more so every day (because they get taken out pretty easily as lasers just aren&rsquo;t the cutting edge weapon tech they once were, shhh).</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;d suggest not even wasting your time attempting to <em>dodge</em> a laser, but you&rsquo;ll never have the opportunity to think about dodging it, much less acting on that thought. The laser, by definition, is moving at the speed of light. And you&rsquo;re not.</p>

        <p>But a little prep can protect you from a lot of cauterization. A laser&rsquo;s energy, therefore its destructive power relies entirely on its coherency. The more that coherency is disrupted on its way to you, the weaker the blast.</p>

        <p>So what will scatter the laser. <em>LITERALLY EVERYTHING!</em> Including the atmosphere. This is probably a big part of why lasers fell out of favor!</p>

        <p>Specially polarized reflective plating is available upon request. It&rsquo;s meant to reflect a portion of the laser&rsquo;s energy, decreasing its energy upon impact. The tactical value of this countermeasure is debatable. It&rsquo;s expensive, difficult to maintain in the field, bulky, useless against conventional weapons, <em>and</em> will probably get you teased. Taunts like, &ldquo;Hey, glitter boy,&rdquo; should not come as a surprise.</p>

        <p>Just remember: &ldquo;Sticks and stones will break my bones, but lasers won&rsquo;t melt my organs.&rdquo; Well, some could, but there&rsquo;s no sense in worrying about those. They&rsquo;re a little like doomsday asteroids. If you see one, it&rsquo;s already too late.</p>
